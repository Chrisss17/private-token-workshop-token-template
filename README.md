# Compliant Private Tokens Workshop - Token Template

üõ°Ô∏è Aleo Compliant Private Tokens Workshop

Welcome to the Aleo Compliant Private Tokens Workshop ‚Äî a hands-on learning experience focused on building compliant and privacy-preserving tokens on the Aleo blockchain.

This workshop introduces participants to the fundamentals of token privacy, compliance mechanisms, and the zero-knowledge-powered architecture that makes Aleo unique.

## üéØ Workshop Overview

In this session, you'll learn how to:

Mint public and private tokens

Transfer tokens in both public and private contexts

Deploy your token program on the Aleo blockchain

Participants will explore the differences between public visibility (for compliance and transparency) and private execution (for confidentiality and user privacy).

## üß© Core Functions
mint_public

Mints a token that is visible and traceable on-chain.
Useful for compliance and regulatory visibility.

mint_private

Mints a token privately using zero-knowledge proofs.
Balances and ownership are hidden from the public ledger.

transfer_public

Transfers tokens publicly ‚Äî viewable by all participants on-chain.
Ideal for audited or regulated transactions.

transfer_private

Transfers tokens privately, ensuring full transactional privacy.
Uses zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions without exposing details.
